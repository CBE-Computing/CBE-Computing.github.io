## What are Configuration Profiles

Configuration Profiles in Jamf Pro are used to manage device settings and enforce security standards across a fleet of devices. They allow administrators to define and distribute settings for Wi-Fi, VPN, restrictions, app configurations, and more, ensuring a consistent user experience and maintaining compliance with organizational policies. 

Key benefits of using Configuration Profiles in Jamf Pro include:

- Simplified deployment of complex settings and security policies
- Centralized management of network, app, and system configurations
- Ability to restrict or enable features across managed devices
- Enhanced control over user experience and device compliance

   - **VPN**: Set up VPN configurations with connection type, server address, and authentication.
   - **Restrictions**: Enable or restrict device functions like the camera, app installation, or screen capture.
   - **Security & Privacy**: Enforce password policies, file encryption, and other security-related settings.

5. **Save and Distribute the Profile**  
   Once the profile is fully configured, save it. After saving, the profile will be deployed to the selected devices. Jamf Pro will automatically push the profile to devices within the defined scope.

6. **Monitor Profile Status and Compliance**  
   Use the *Logs* and *Device Inventory* sections in Jamf Pro to track the deployment and ensure devices comply with the profileâ€™s settings. If necessary, you can edit or remove profiles to address any issues.
