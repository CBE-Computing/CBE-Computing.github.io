## How to Edit

- **Click `Edit This Page On Github`**  
   To edit a page simply click on the `Edit This Page On Github` at the bottom of the page you wish to edit. If you are part of the CBE-Computing organization on Github you should automatically have access to edit the page. If you do not have permissions make sure that the Computing Director has invited you to the `CBE Computing` Github Organization.
